Hi, I'm Solomon.  
This is my first time to write an article with Markdown.  

With this blog, hope I can continuely do writing or make notes here.   
It'll be a great move for my improvement of skills.  

# Update Dec, 2015
Acutally, I've changed my blog to Github - **Issues**. It seems to be a more popular and comfortable blog-space, ranther than this Github - Pages. 
Anyway, for visiting my blog, please enter my issues within the same repository, or click the url here:[Issues - Solomon Xie](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues)
